There are some things you'll probably want to know when you start working at Sunlight. This document will hopefully give you a head start.

## Staff Listing

You can find a directory of all Sunlight staff, advisors, and contractors on the [Sunlight team page](http://sunlightfoundation.com/team/).

## Staff Portal

The [Sunlight staff portal](http://sunlightfoundation.com/staff) is a helpful page where you can find quick access to:

* Sitewide statistics
* Your profile including title, bio, social media presence, image, blogposts and contact information
* A staff contact directory that you should keep up-to-date
* WordPress access
* A link to our [blog style guide](https://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/styleguide/)
* A shortcut to the Appear.in "hangout"
* A shortcut to Rex, our custom kitchen duty app
* Access to the sunlightfoundation.com admin

## Slack

We primarily use [Slack](https://sunlight.slack.com/) for office and team communications. There are channels for [#labs](https://sunlight.slack.com/messages/labs/), [#design](https://sunlight.slack.com/messages/design/), [#general](https://sunlight.slack.com/messages/general/), etc. We also have a private channel [#labs-private](https://sunlight.slack.com/messages/labs-private/) for Labs internal communications. Request an invite if you haven't been invited already!

## Trello

We primarily use [Trello](https://trello.com/) for project management. Check out our boards [here](https://trello.com/sunlightlabs). Perhaps the most important board is the [Lab's Meta Board](https://trello.com/b/kzsvElaz/labs). It's critical you have access to these boards so ask Kat or Clayton if you can't access them.

## Email & Calendar

We currently use Google Apps for email and calendar (and Google Docs/Drive). Your username is your first initial and last name at sunlightfoundation.com. (For example: jdoe@sunlightfoundation.com). You can log in through Gmail by using your Sunlight Foundation e-mail address. If you are having trouble logging into your e-mail account or don't think you have one set up, find Clayton.

Please also check out [Sunlight's Google Apps](http://www.google.com/a/sunlightfoundation.com) which include Google Docs and Google Calendar.

### Internal Mailing Lists

Email lists were much more important in the early years of Sunlight (circa late 2000's to early 2010's). We primarily use [Slack](https://sunlight.slack.com/) for communication now. However, for longer correspondences we still use email.

Consider signing up for these mailing lists:

* [All Staff](mailto:allstaff@sunlightfoundation.com) - You don't want to miss this one - Double check with Scott that you are signed up if you don't get all staff email after a day or two.
* [All Labs](mailto:alllabs@sunlightfoundation.com) - Another not-to-be-missed list.

There are also ad-hoc email lists for other things as well, but may have faded into disuse over the years as we moved to Slack.

### Shared Calendars

You may want to ensure that you have access some of our shared calendars. Access is handled by Operations.

#### Organizational Calendars

* Sunlight Foundation - The primary calendar for making events known organization-wide. Any events that involve physical absence from the office (including vacation, remote work, and travel) should be posted on this calendar.
* Labs - The calendar for posting events that should be known to all of Sunlight Labs.

#### Room Calendars

These calendars are used to schedule reserved time in a specific room:

* Conference Room
* Breakout South
* Breakout North
* Booth South
* Booth North
* Work Room

## Twitter

You can find a [full list of Sunlight staff that use Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/SunFoundation/sunlighters).

## Google Groups

We have a **sunlightlabs** Google Group, "An open list for software developers interested in open government, government transparency, and civic hacking." We also have a **Sunlight Labs API Discussion** group. People ask us questions about our APIs there.

## Dropbox

We have a `Labs` shared folder that gets some use, a `Design` shared folder which is huge and gets a lot of use, and a `sunlight-operations` folder (that is for all of Sunlight). Contact Clayton, Andy, or Albert for access.

## Developer tools

Use what you want! A number of people like [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), some use Vim or Emacs. [Atom](https://atom.io/) calls itself "the future," so there's that. If there is something you want that is *costs money* (a reasonable amount), we may be able to buy it for you.

## Version Control

We use [Git](http://git-scm.com) for source code management and pushes to production. You should become proficient in Git if you're not already. Please visit the [Sunlight Labs GitHub account](https://github.com/sunlightlabs).

## Supplies

Supplies are in the supply room. It is primarily a free-for-all in there. Have at it if you need pens, paper, etc. If you can't find what you are looking for, contact Scott. Also, please feel free to take initiative and clean out junk if you think it is piling up.
